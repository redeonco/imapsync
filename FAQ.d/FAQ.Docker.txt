Now the questions again with their answers.

======================================================================
Q. How can I install and use the imapsync Docker image on my amd64 system?

R. Install Docker on your system. Once Docker is installed on your system,
   all you have to do in order install and run imapsync is the command line:

  docker run gilleslamiral/imapsync imapsync <usual imapsync arguments>

======================================================================
Q. How can I install and use the imapsync Docker image on my i386 system?

R1. You can't do it directly for now. It will throw this error when running it:

  docker run gilleslamiral/imapsync imapsync
  standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "exec format error"

I plan to make the image multi-plateform. Drop me a note if you are
eager to have it.

R2. Build the image on a i386 system with the exact same Dockerfile provided
and run it on your i386 system.

======================================================================
Q. How can I install or update only the imapsync Docker image on my system?

R. To install or update the imapsync image, run:

  docker pull gilleslamiral/imapsync

======================================================================
Q. Where is the imapsync Docker hub location?

R. Here:

  https://hub.docker.com/r/gilleslamiral/imapsync/

======================================================================
Q. How can I mask the passwords on the command line without mounting 
   anything inside the container?

R. Use a file defining the environment variables 
   IMAPSYNC_PASSWORD1 and IMAPSYNC_PASSWORD2

  cat ./secret.txt
IMAPSYNC_PASSWORD1=secret1
IMAPSYNC_PASSWORD2=secret2

Use that file like this for a run:

  docker run --env-file ./secret.txt gilleslamiral/imapsync imapsync ...

See:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file

======================================================================
Q. Why imapsync isn't logging to a file in Docker context. 
   How can I allow it?

R. In Docker context, writing the log is disabled by default because you 
   don't have an easy access to the logfile after the sync. The logfile is 
   inside the docker and no longer available after the sync, unless
   a special mount is done before.

Starting with imapsync release 2.113 the logging can be turned on 
by using the option --log. You can add access to the logfile with a mount 
or similar. See https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/"

======================================================================
Q. Any tips for the Docker Mailcow distribution?

R. With the Mailcow distribution, imapsync is running inside a Docker 
   container. Quoting Mathilde:

To make it work with Mailcow, options should be added like this:

  --regexflag=s/\\Indexed//gi

Without spaces, without quotes.

See the original Mathilde's comment:

https://github.com/imapsync/imapsync/issues/201#issuecomment-559500077

======================================================================
Q. How can I build my own image?

R. Use the following command to build the image:

   docker build -t gilleslamiral/imapsync . 
 
   with the Dockerfile in the current directory.

The latest Dockerfile can be found at
https://imapsync.lamiral.info/INSTALL.d/Dockerfile
or 
https://hub.docker.com/r/gilleslamiral/imapsync
or 
https://imapsync.lamiral.info/INSTALL.d/INSTALL.Docker_build.txt


======================================================================
Q. What do you do to update the docker hub image?

R. I do in my imapsync directory:

    make docker_build
    make docker_upload_docker_hub
    
Then I go to
https://hub.docker.com/r/gilleslamiral/imapsync

I edit and update the docker "Readme" with the last Dockerfile I used.
I also update INSTALL.Docker_build.txt with the last Dockerfile

I also update the last Dockerfile on the imapsync site with:

   make upload_index
