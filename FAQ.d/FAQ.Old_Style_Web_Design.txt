              Imapsync and its ugly website style
=======================================================================

=======================================================================
Q. Why the imapsync website looks so old fashion?

R. Once in a while I receive messages from people complaining about 
the website style, not that much about the content by the way,
as people don't read.

I know the imapsync website has a grandmother style,
I'm not offended by complaints about it.

Here are several reasons it stays like that for now:

* I like to do things myself

* I am lazy

* I like static web.
  Although you could argue that I do use some dynamic things, like SSI. 
  That's true, I use Server Side Include, aka SSI, denoted by the ".shtml" 
  extention of some files, instead of the classical ".html" extention.
  It's because I like dynamic web when the dynamic brings something that
  can't be done easily with static files.
  

* I'm proud to be w3c compliant

  Very very few sites are w3c compliant, it's because nearly all CMS frameworks aren't.
  Only true crazy people are w3c compliant seekers. I'm one of them.
  If you know a CMS w3c compliant, tell me, it will be such a crazy news.
  If you know any web site w3c compliant, tell me, it will be crazy news as well.
  Update: https://contao.org/ is a CMS and it is w3c compliant! This is astonishing!
  (Thanks to Markus Rupprecht for this crazy input!)
  
* I prefer to spend more time on the product itself than the showcase

* The product is a command line, a fancy website to sell a command line
  makes more disappointed buyers

I agree I could do some sort of A/B experiment and see whether during
a month I sell more imapsync on a brand new style B site than
the current A one.


Besides, don't misunderstand buyers. The surprising thing about complainers
is that all are web designers, none of them is a user not in the webdesign branch.

I even received some phone call from a buyer saying: "I saw your website 
and I told to myself: this can't be a fake one, the product must be a good one".

Another folk like me:

(well, not w3c compliant, he is not that mad)

So maybe one day...
